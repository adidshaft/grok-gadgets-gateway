# Changelog

## 0.1.0a1 — local alpha candidate, 2026-10-04

- Canonical 0.1.0 schemas/fixtures and custom capability discovery.
- Reusable device lifecycle, bounded event cursor history, command idempotency and honest acknowledgement statuses.
- Explicit C124 software simulator and Grok-facing tools via official MCP Python SDK stdio.
- Loopback device credentials/revocation and USB NDJSON bridge.
- Official MCP client acceptance, TCP authentication/lifecycle tests and USB pseudo-terminal transcript acceptance.

### Audit corrections

- Reject simulator event/read names as commands, expose callable discovery accurately, and preserve custom SDK command capabilities.
- Isolate 256 retained event IDs per device/current boot; preserve same-boot reconnect deduplication and bound retired boot/session bookkeeping.
- Add real MCP negative command coverage, two authenticated device event isolation, and direct lifecycle/retention boundary regressions.

Pending: real Grok Bot/mobile, physical C124, public/remote authenticated MCP transport, durable delivery and independent installation.
